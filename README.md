# Server-Performance-Stats

I’ve written a script called server-stats.sh that can be run on any Linux server to quickly analyze and display key performance statistics. Here’s what it provides:

⚡ Total CPU usage — shows how much of the CPU is being consumed versus idle.

💾 Total memory usage — reports free vs. used memory along with the usage percentage.

📂 Total disk usage — displays free vs. used disk space and the percentage of usage.

🔥 Top 5 processes by CPU usage — helps identify which processes are consuming the most CPU.

🧠 Top 5 processes by memory usage — highlights the processes using the most memory
